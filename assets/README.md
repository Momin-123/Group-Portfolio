# Assets Folder

This folder should contain the following images:

## Profile Pictures (Required)
Place 5 profile pictures here, named:
- `profile-placeholder.png` (or `profile1.png`, `profile2.png`, etc.)

**Recommendations:**
- Square images (recommended: 500x500px or larger)
- PNG or JPG format
- Clear, professional photos
- Images will be automatically cropped to circles

## Project Images (Optional)
Place project screenshots here, named:
- `project-placeholder.png` (or specific project names like `project1.png`, etc.)

**Recommendations:**
- Rectangular images (recommended: 1200x800px or similar aspect ratio)
- PNG or JPG format
- High quality screenshots of your projects

## Note
If you don't have images yet, the website will still work but images won't display. Make sure to:
1. Replace `profile-placeholder.png` with actual team member photos
2. Replace `project-placeholder.png` with actual project screenshots
3. Update the image paths in `index.html` if you use different filenames
